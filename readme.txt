Randomizer for Cliffhanger Redux
A few changes were made to the rom for this randomizer to function (better)
1. Planet awakens in the usual 'pit' room, which wakes up after morph is collected.
-  This way the game seems to function as the original, with the pit room asleep on the first visit and awake after Morph.
-  Furthermore, morph will always be at the usual location or the Construction Zone adjacent to it (speed locked).
2. Some Wrecked Ship rooms were switched to an alternate state to allow reverse traversal of the Wrecked Ship and keep all items potentially on the table.
-  A portion of this is a 1-screen X-Ray climb up the bowling room, which is in-logic.
-  Also, the "basement" outside phantoon's room is reconnected with the room above. With Ice and X-Ray, you can clip with an Atomix into the room above (which is now a functioning door transition into the "asleep"
-  All Wrecked Ship items can now be collected and you are never truly "locked out" of the two E-tanks.

All locations utilize an in-and-out logic as usual, and there are some points of no return to mention:
- Entering the left side of Brinstar through gauntlet needs items to escape. Either you use grapple to escape through the "Zigzag" rooms or you need a combination of items to escape through the plasma area: Gravity-or-Springball and Plasma-or-Screw.
- Blue tower, like vanilla red tower has a small section at the bottom that need some up logic to escape. There are many options, including traversing the reserve tanks area to get back up blue tower.
- Though it does not seem to require Supers to enter the wrecked ship through the front door, you will need them after Phantoon to leave. So make sure you have Supers to go fight Phantoon!
- The elevator up from the grapple gladiator into the back of the WS lab has asleep robots that will trap you in, so you must kill Phantoon before you enter the WS from this direction. Essentially, this path is only once if you have already entered the WS from another direction to kill Phantoon.
- And there are probably many more since Cliffhanger Redux is a challenging hack!
